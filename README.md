# Generative Audio from Visual Data

## Project Overview

This project generates audio tracks based on visual data extracted from videos. Visual features such as color, brightness, contrast, and motion are mapped to different audio characteristics to create unique soundscapes.

## Features

- Extracts visual data from video files.
- Maps visual features to audio characteristics.
- Generates and saves audio tracks as WAV files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-audio.git
    cd generative-audio
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy scipy
    ```

4. **Download Additional Requirements**

    If additional requirements are needed, list them here.

### Usage

1. **Prepare Your Video File**

   Place your video file in the `src/mp4/` directory or specify a path to your video file in the script.

2. **Run the Script to Extract Visual Data**

    ```bash
    python video_to_audio_v2.py
    ```

   This script processes the video and generates JSON and CSV files with visual data. The JSON file will include the `video_duration` field, which is essential for correlating the length of the generated audio with the length of the video.

3. **Generate Audio from Visual Data**

    ```bash
    python audio_from_data_v0.py
    ```

   This script creates a WAV file based on the extracted visual data. It uses the `video_duration` field from the JSON file to ensure that the length of the audio file corresponds to the length of the video.

### Code

- **`video_to_audio_v2.py`**: Extracts visual features from video and saves them to JSON and CSV files. Includes the `video_duration` in the JSON file for accurate audio length.
- **`audio_from_data_v0.py`**: Generates audio from the visual features data and saves it as a WAV file. Uses the `video_duration` to determine frame duration and ensure correct audio length.

### JSON Data Structure

The JSON file generated by the `video_to_audio_v2.py` script includes:

- **video_duration**: The total duration of the video in seconds.
- **frames**: A list of dictionaries, each containing:
  - `avg_color`: Average color of the frame (list of RGB values).
  - `mass`: Mass of the frame (number of pixels within a certain color range).
  - `brightness`: Brightness of the frame.
  - `contrast`: Contrast of the frame.
  - `motion`: Motion detected in the frame.

### Dependencies

- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scipy**: For audio file handling.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check if the directory paths are correct.
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed.
- Verify that your internet connection is stable if you're installing packages.
- Make sure the JSON file structure matches the expected format with `video_duration` and `frames`.
